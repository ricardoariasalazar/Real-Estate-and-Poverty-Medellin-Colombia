# Real-Estate-and-Poverty-Medellin-Colombia
Medellin is the second-largest city in Colombia, with 2.6 million inhabitants. The city is divided into 22 different 
areas called communes where people live. In Medell√≠n, Colombia the segregation by the income level of the 
people throughout the territory is clear, unlike Melbourne, there you can easily identify which is the area inhabited 
by people with higher income and which by people with less, the objective of this project is to discover if this 
prior thought is true or if there is another unseen pattern.

To reach the goal mentioned before, we are going to use three different datasets, obtained from three different 
places. The first one is an open dataset provided by Properati (the Latin American real estate search site) that 
provides detailed information of properties around Latin America, like price, operation type, property type, and 
some other relevant attributes of a property. The second one is an open dataset of the local government of 
Medellin, Colombia that provides the shapes of the communes of the city and will help us to add one more unseen 
attribute of the last dataset, the commune where is located each property, and the third one is an open data set of 
the government of Colombia that provides the Multidimensional Poverty Index of each block of the city, that 
could also let us add an attribute of poverty to the Properati Dataset.
With this new dataset created, we would like to build a dashboard that could be helpful for different people to 
identify what is the relationship between poverty (measured by the Multidimensional Poverty Index), communes, 
house pricing.
